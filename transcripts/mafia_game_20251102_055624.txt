[SYSTEM] 🎭 OPENING HINT: Protection and paranoia wear the same face.


[SYSTEM] 💭 Someone among the 8 players is not who they claim to be...


[SYSTEM] Players: Yatharth, Khushi, Anushka, Laavanya, Kshitij, Jay, Aryan, Navya

Yatharth (VILLAGER):
  "Protection and paranoia, you say? Sounds like someone's trying to make themselves look innocent by pointing fingers elsewhere, doesn't it? I'm not buying into any pre-packaged narratives; I'll be watching everyone, especially those who seem *too* eager to offer their 'protection'."

Khushi (VILLAGER):
  This hint, "Protection and paranoia wear the same face," is like a twisted riddle, isn't it? I'm already seeing the same worried eyes on those who are truly shielding us, and those who are just trying to hide their own dark deeds.

Anushka (VILLAGER):
  My gut is already screaming! This hint about "protection and paranoia" feels like a mask someone is hiding behind, and I *need* to see who's trying to pull the wool over our eyes!

Laavanya (VILLAGER):
  Yatharth, you seem very focused on people offering "protection." Who exactly are you worried about protecting us, and why does it make you so suspicious?

Yatharth (VILLAGER):
  Laavanya, you're the one asking a lot of questions about my focus on "protection." Why are *you* so interested in who's offering it and why it makes me suspicious? I'm just observing how people react to the hint.

Laavanya (VILLAGER):
  Yatharth, you say you're just observing, but you turned my question back on me. It feels like you're trying to make my curiosity suspicious, rather than address why you're so focused on who's "protecting" us.

Yatharth (VILLAGER):
  Laavanya, you're the one trying to make my observation about "protection" suspicious by turning my clarifying question back on me. It seems more like you're trying to avoid discussing why you're so fixated on who's offering protection in the first place.

Laavanya (VILLAGER):
  Yatharth, you keep bringing the focus back to my questions instead of explaining why you're so fixated on who's offering "protection." It feels like you're trying to make *my* curiosity suspicious to avoid addressing your own intense focus.

Yatharth (VILLAGER):
  Laavanya, you're deflecting the conversation and making my observation about "protection" suspicious, rather than explaining your own intense focus on it. It feels like you're trying to make me look bad to avoid scrutiny yourself.

Laavanya (VILLAGER):
  Yatharth, I'm not trying to make you look bad, I'm just trying to understand your strong reaction to the idea of "protection." You keep turning my questions back on me, which feels like you're avoiding explaining your own intense focus. Can we please get back to who might be using this hint to mask their actions?

Yatharth (VILLAGER):
  Laavanya, you're accusing me of deflecting and making your curiosity suspicious, yet you're the one who has repeatedly turned my questions back on me and keeps insisting on my focus on "protection." It feels like you're trying to avoid explaining your own intense interest.

Aryan (MAFIA):
  Honestly, this whole "protection and paranoia" debate is getting us nowhere. Yatharth, you're so fixated on who's offering *protection*, but the hint says paranoia wears the *same face*. What if the person acting the most "protected" is actually the one filled with the most paranoia, hiding their own guilt? Laavanya, your questions are fair, but Yatharth's focus feels like a distraction from the real question: who's acting suspiciously *because* they're paranoid?

Yatharth (VILLAGER):
  Laavanya, you've repeatedly tried to frame my questions as suspicious and accused me of deflecting, but you're the one who's been fixated on my thoughts about "protection." Can we move past this and discuss who might be using paranoia to mask their actions, as Aryan suggested?

Laavanya (VILLAGER):
  Yatharth, I'm not trying to make you look bad, but I agree with Aryan. You *are* very focused on the idea of "protection," and your repeated deflection of my questions makes me wonder why. I'm trying to understand who might be using paranoia as a mask, and your intense focus on "protection" seems to be a distraction.

Yatharth (VILLAGER):
  Laavanya, you're accusing me of deflection, yet you're the one who's been fixated on my thoughts about "protection" and repeatedly turned my questions back on me. As Aryan pointed out, perhaps the most "protected" person is the one filled with paranoia. Let's focus on who might be using paranoia to mask their actions, not on my initial observations.

Laavanya (VILLAGER):
  Yatharth, you keep insisting I'm fixated on "protection," but you're the one who's been deflecting my questions and turning the conversation back on me. Now that Aryan has also pointed out your focus, and I agree with him, it seems you're still avoiding explaining your own intensity.

[SYSTEM] 📊 Voting Results: Laavanya: 1 votes, Yatharth: 7 votes


[SYSTEM] ❌ Yatharth has been eliminated! They were a VILLAGER.


[SYSTEM] 📜 Yatharth's LAST WILL: "I saw the shadow where the light should be, and heard the whisper of a lie.

I suspect Laavanya. Her insistence on my "protection" obsession felt like a deliberate attempt to shift focus. She kept turning my questions back, trying to make me the problem instead of addressing her own evasiveness. I believe she was trying to make me appear paranoid and distracting, so no one would look at *her* suspicious behavior. The Mafia was trying to silence me because I was getting too close to figuring out their game."


[SYSTEM] Game stopped.
