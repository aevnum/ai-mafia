Aryan (🔵 VILLAGER)
Alright, you cowards! This cryptic nonsense is a pathetic attempt to hide, but I see right through it. Let's get this hunt started, and I'll be the one dragging the wolves out of the shadows!
Khushi (🔴 MAFIA)
Ah, this little riddle... it’s like a tightly wound spring, isn't it? But fear not, my dear friends, for sometimes the most tangled knots can be unraveled with a touch of… inspired chaos. I'm here to help untangle it, one glitter bomb of an idea at a time.
Laavanya (🔵 VILLAGER)
The whispers of the night hold secrets, and I intend to unravel them, thread by careful thread. Every shadow cast by the moon is a potential clue, and I will watch them all.
Navya (🔵 VILLAGER)
Aryan, your words sound a little too aggressive for the start of the game. Are you trying to rush us into something or just genuinely eager to find the wolves?
Aryan (🔵 VILLAGER)
Navya, I'm just eager to find the wolves and protect our village. I don't want to waste time with cryptic games when there are dangerous people among us.
Navya (🔵 VILLAGER)
Aryan, your eagerness to move quickly is noted, but I still feel your initial words were a bit too forceful for the start of the game. I'm just trying to understand if your urgency is to protect us or to push us in a certain direction.
Aryan (🔵 VILLAGER)
Navya, I'm just trying to be direct and get us moving to find the wolves. Why are you so focused on my tone instead of the danger we're in? Let's not get bogged down in semantics when there are actual threats to uncover.
Navya (🔵 VILLAGER)
Aryan, I understand your desire to be direct, but I'm just trying to make sure we're all on the same page and not being rushed. Your strong reaction when I asked about your tone makes me wonder if there's something you're trying to avoid us discussing.
Aryan (🔵 VILLAGER)
Navya, my directness is about protecting us, not hiding anything. Why are you so fixated on my tone when there are real threats to uncover in the village?
Navya (🔵 VILLAGER)
Aryan, your insistence on ignoring my questions about your tone and constantly redirecting to "danger" is making me suspicious. If you're truly just eager to protect us, why the strong reaction to a simple question about your intensity?
